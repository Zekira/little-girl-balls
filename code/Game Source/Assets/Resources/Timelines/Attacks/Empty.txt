//These files are used to create attack patterns and stages runtime, while still being fairly easy to edit
//Any newlines are disregarded; they start after ;// (and the file start) and end in a ;
//You cannot indent
//These are the implemented functions:
//setBulletProperty(name,property,value), createBullet(name), wait(value), setNum(name,value), addNum(name,value,value), subNum(name,value,value), mulNum(name,value,value), divNum(name,value,value),
modNum(name,value,value), powNum(name,value,value), sinNum(name,value), cosNum(name,value), tanNum(name,value), absNum(name,value), asinNum(name,value), acosNum(name,value), atanNum(name,value);
//name is what you refer a variable by;
//value is either a number or a name. can't be a function;
//property is one of the following: movementx, movementy, isharmful, scale, id, colorise, colorr, colorg, colorb, colora;
